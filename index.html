<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Deep Learning models are at the core of research in Artificial Intelligence research today. In the era of big data, the importance of being able to effectively mine and learn from graph data is growing, as more and more structured and semi-structured data is becoming available. The success of graph can be attributed to its ability to capture the structural information of the data, extract meaningful features, and reveal the causal inference behind the data. It is a great deal of interest in analyzing data that is best represented as a graph, such as social networks, biological networks, communication networks, and molecular structure networks. The intersection of graph theory and deep learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, program synthesis and analysis, automated planning, reinforcement learning, and data security. Despite these successes, graph neural networks still face many methodological, applicable, or interpretable challenges. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from data mining and machine learning domains to discuss the latest developments and applications of graph-related works. We encourage a lively exchange of ideas and perceptions to share and discuss their latest findings, focused on data-driven science and data mining. The workshop will feature invited talks and contributed papers to provide a platform for exchanging ideas and fostering collaborations.</p>

<h3 id="Registration">Registration</h3>
<p>Each paper needs to have at least one full registration in order to get your paper published in the conference proceedings. If you are a student author and you are the only one to register for the paper, then you need to pay the full registration,  not the student registration.  The author registration deadline is Nov 22, 2023. If you pay by wire-transfer, pls note that wire-transfer normally take about 10 days to actually transfer the fund from your bank account to the IEEE BigData 2023 account, make sure your payment is received by Nov 22, otherwise your paper won't be published in the conference proceedings.  Pls follow the
